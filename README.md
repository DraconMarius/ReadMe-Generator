## Method
I was tasked with creating an interactive command-line application that will prompt user for input when run. First, I focues on compiling the prompts and answers using inquirer to see the type of answers and how it is organized. Once I had my answers formatted, I worked on introducing additional logic using `when:` functionality within inquirer to ask conditional questions based on previous answers. 

After ensuring that I had captured all the information that is required, I then focued on creating a simple markdown template that allows us to start plugging in some of the value that we received from inquirer.js. 

Once I was able to gnereate a markdown file based on user inputs correctly, I then implemeneted a switch case that would generate a license badge based on user's input and append include it in the generation of the markdown file. *badges hosted by shield.io*

I also created an additional feature where user is able to provide optional github username or linkedin url that will append the relevant badge/credit within the contact me section.
